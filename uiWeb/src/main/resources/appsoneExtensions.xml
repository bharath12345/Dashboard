        All uiExtension.xml are provided in "uiExtension.action" servlets. For example,

        /dashboard/applications/uiExtension.action ==> has all definition for Applications Accordion etc
        /dashboard/transactions/uiExtension.action ==> has all definition for Transactions Accordion etc
        /dashboard/analytics/uiExtension.action =====> has all definition for Analytics Accordion etc

        The v1 will support only co-deployed extensions. Future versions with security layers will allow
         remote extensions

        There are two types of extensions. Packaged extensions developed by AppsOne product team and
            external extensions developed by AppsOne plugin's team. So, there are two XML's -
            one) For AppsOne 'core' extensions - packaged within the WAR
            two) For AppsOne 'external' extensions - packaged outside the WAR in some system path

    <extension id="Transaction" url="/uiTransactionExtension"/>
    <extension id="Analytics" url="/uiAnalyticsExtension"/>
