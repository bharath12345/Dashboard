1) This jar and source has been generated using the scomp command of xmlbeans v2.6.0
2) The jar generated by scomp is installed into maven using the below command. This artifact and version is
    referenced from "uiExtensionLib" as a dependency. Command -

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=uiExtensionXmlBeans.jar -DgroupId=com.appnomic.appsone.dashboard -DartifactId=uiExtensionXmlBeans -Dversion=04.20.100.000 -Dpackaging=jar

3) The default dependency for xmlbeans classes in maven is -

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.xmlbeans</groupId>
            <artifactId>xmlbeans-xmlpublic</artifactId>
            <version>2.6.0</version>
        </dependency>

    However, the JAR downloaded by having this dependency from public repositories was not sufficient to
    compile and run the 'generated' source code. What was required was to use the exact same JAR as packaged
    in the downloaded and 'externally' installed Apache XmlBeans 2.6.0. So, I had to rename this JAR -

    ".m2/repository/org/apache/xmlbeans/xmlbeans-xmlpublic/2.6.0/xmlbeans-xmlpublic-2.6.0.jar"

    from external download (size: 440kb) to a temporary name and used the xbean.jar packaged with the downloaded
    version of XmlBeans (size: 2.7MB). Doing so got rid of all compilation and run-time problems
